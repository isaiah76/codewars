# Sorted?yes?no?how?

Complete the method which accepts an array of integers, and returns one of the following:

- `"yes, ascending"` - if the numbers in the array are sorted in an ascending order
- `"yes, descending"` - if the numbers in the array are sorted in a descending order
- `"no"` - otherwise

The order does not have to be strict: a sorted array can contain consecutive duplicates, e.g. `[1, 1, 2, 3]` is sorted in ascending order.

It is guaranteed that there will always be a unique valid answer. More precisely:

- there will be no arrays with less than 2 elements
- there will be no arrays where all elements are equal
